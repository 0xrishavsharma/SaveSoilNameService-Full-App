# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

This project demonstrates a basic use case of Solidity, React and Hardhat by building a Domain Registration Platform.

Tech stack used:

Metamask (For signing transactions and interaction with the blockchain)
Mumbai Testnet (A testnet blockchain for the deployment of project)
Solidity (Language for writing smart contracts)
React.js (A framework to building the frontend of Web Apps)
We mainly used hooks to change the state of variables and run something when the page relodes(useEffect)
Hardhat (For deployment to the Testnet and to run tests before deployment)
