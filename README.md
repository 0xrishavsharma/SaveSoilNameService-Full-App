Building a Name Service Platform on the Mumbai Testnet
```

This project demonstrates a basic use case of Solidity, React and Hardhat by building a Domain Registration Platform.

Tech stack used:

Metamask (For signing transactions and interaction with the blockchain)
Mumbai Testnet (A testnet blockchain for the deployment of project)
Solidity (Language for writing smart contracts)
React.js (A framework to building the frontend of Web Apps)
We mainly used hooks to change the state of variables and run something when the page relodes(useEffect)
Hardhat (For deployment to the Testnet and to run tests before deployment)
